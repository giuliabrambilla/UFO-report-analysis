# UFO-report-analysis
Jupyter notebook containing a data analysis of UFO sightings happened in the United States.

The United States' NUFORC (National UFO Research Center) collects and serves over 100,000 reports of UFO sightings.

The dataset has been extracted from a the raw report in .json format that contains the information exactly as it appears on the NUFORC website, including the sighting time, location, duration, and other attributes.

## Objective
Through the analysis of the available data, I will try answering to the following questions:

- Which is the most common UFO shape seen?
- Where do most of the UFO sightings happen (in which state)?
- Which are the states with the most UFO sightings per capita?
- What is the year with most sightings?
- In what time of the year (month) do people report seeing more UFOs?
- And in what time of the day?
- Are there patterns in the sightings descripions? What do people exactly see?
